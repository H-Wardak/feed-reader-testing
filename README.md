# Project Overview

In this project, we used Jasmine test library to validate that all our website functions developed properly. The website is about a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. 

## How to Run?

Just download or clone the repository. Open index.html in a browser and you can see test results are shown in the bottom of the page.

The test suits can be found in `jasmine/spec/feedreader.js`
